This is my Demo of a MongoDB-Database-Application.
This is a library of fantasy books.

To access the landing page http://localhost:3000
  There are three categories:
    /comics
    /fantasy
    /scifi

You could also search for specific :id, after you have selected a category.

Using postman you would be able to GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE data.
